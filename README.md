AC code in several OJ website

Many of these problems are on POJ, http://poj.org/

POJ does not support C++11 feature so many wonderful skills cannot be used like lambda and auto type deductions.

ACMTemplate is a collection of correct and clear implements of data structure which are frequently used in ACM contests and programming projects. It is important to remember them, never too much.
